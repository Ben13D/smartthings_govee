### DISCLOSURE
I am not SmartThings developer, I just did this because I wanted to be able to integrate my multiple Govee LED Light strips into my Smart home network, so I created this myself.  It works well for me and this isn't for sale, so feel free to use it, tweak it, whatever you want!
Just a heads up, this isn't perfect by any means, so feel free to provide me some input and updates, I'll be happy to make them!

Enjoy!
